\subsection*{Progress Update}
%     \item \textbf{Current Progress:} [Describe what you have accomplished up to this point.]
%     \item \textbf{Comparison to Plan:} [Identify how your current progress matches or does not
%       match the progress you anticipated in your project plan.]

Currently we have successfully implemented a method to parse an \texttt{.obj} file and store the
mesh of triangles into the GPU memory. After the triangles are copied to the device memory, we are
able to correctly render the object using ray casting to determine the correct triangle 
intersection and interpolate the vertex normal to compute the normal map of each pixel being
rendered. Furthermore, we have implemented a basic ``lambertian'' shading model to
compute the color of the intersected triangle point based on the light source position.

This matches the timeline of our project plan which also gave us extra time to read up on
literature and useful libraries that will be paramount for the next steps of our project.

\subsection*{Implementation Details}
%   \item \textbf{Implementation:} [Describe the current state of your code implementation,
%       including any algorithms and optimizations you have applied.]
%   \item \textbf{Performance Measurements:} [Present appropriate performance measurements of your
%       code implementation to date.]
% [GitHub Repository Link]

\subsection*{Project Plan Revisions}
%   \item \textbf{Revisions:} [Detail any changes to your project plan.]
%   \item \textbf{Justification:} [Explain why these revisions are necessary.
%       It is common and expected for projects to change direction slightly during implementation.]

Clearer Objectives have been set for the next steps of our project:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Cornell Box Scene
    \item Monte Carlo Path tracing
    \item True Lambertian Diffuse Reflection
\end{itemize}
