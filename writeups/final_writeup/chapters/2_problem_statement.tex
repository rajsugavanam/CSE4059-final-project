\section{Problem Statement}

We address the computational problem of non-real-time, physically-based path
tracing that is facilitated through parallelism. We specifically make the
tradeoff to forgo simulation time in favor of more accurate light bounces. We
only considered meshes composed of triangular faces, as every polygonal mesh
can be decomposed to fit this. Furthermore, it greatly simplifies how we
represent models in the code, which permits further optimizations.
